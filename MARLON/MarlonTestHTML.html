            has several possibilities for this. </p>
        <p>You can take a longer time on the trip, but use a transport that you feel is safer. or can
            get faster taking more risks. </p>
        <p> If we think about investments, the logic is the same: depending on what your objective is, there are

            profiles. </p>

    <h2>
        How to know your investor profile?
    </h2>

    <h3>→ Conservative</h3>

    <p>Conservatives are financial risk-averse investors. The vast majority of those in this group are people who
        are used to saving money and have some beliefs and customs. This type of individual is the dream of bank
        managers, as they are primarily responsible for buying capitalization bonds.</p>



    <p> This fact makes the conservatives are extremely favorable to the Savings Account, even knowing its low
        profitability. The security linked to the type of investment is the main factor for this investor profile.
    </p>



    <p> It is worth remembering that conservatives invest a large part of their capital (approximately 80% to 90%)
        in fixed income. Some people even choose to invest in shares of large companies on the Stock Exchange due to
        their stability and ability to generate profits.</p>


    <h3>→ Moderate</h3>
    <p>Moderators are investors who are willing to take a greater risk than conservatives. An interesting feature of
        this profile is knowing how to listen. Despite this, they need some time to understand the news in the
        market and decide to bet, but at the slightest sign of vulnerability, they return to safe investments. </p>



    <p>This profile has the habit of making investments in fixed and variable income in a considerable percentage,
        always seeking the highest possible profitability. Usually they invest 50% in fixed income and 50% in
        variable income, thus having a well diversified portfolio.</p>



    <p>The great advantage of diversification, combined with sensitivity to insecurity, makes investors of this
        profile make excellent choices, thus obtaining satisfactory results (in the medium and long term). The focus
        of their investment is CDB's, Tesouro Direto, Private Pension and, occasionally, shares of top-tier
        companies (which usually make up their portfolios).</p>


    <h3>→ Bold</h3>
    <p>
        This group is formed by investors who have, predominantly, variable income investments (stocks, foreign
        currencies, real estate funds, among others). People who fit into this category are considered professionals
        and have profitability well above average. </p>



    <p> High profitability rates are associated with high risks. Being a bold investor requires technical
        preparation and time available to follow the economic scenario. It also takes a lot of cold blood, as there
        are strong emotions, especially in times of crisis.
